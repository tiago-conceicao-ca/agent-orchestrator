/**
 * Canonical path-equality helpers.
 *
 * On Windows, `realpathSync` can return canonically resolved paths whose
 * drive-letter case and 8.3-vs-long-name expansion differ from the input
 * even when both inputs point to the same filesystem entry (e.g. one input
 * came from a config file and another from `process.cwd()` after a chdir).
 * A naive `===` comparison misses these as "different paths" and the calling
 * code falls into "treat as new" branches — for project resolution this
 * presents to the user as phantom "register this project?" prompts even
 * when the project is already registered.
 *
 * This module centralises the comparison so every site that asks "are
 * these two paths the same on disk?" gets the same answer regardless of
 * platform. POSIX behaviour is unchanged (case-sensitive `===`).
